This repository contains some of the interesting silk performance code snippets for my Silk projects. It is written in Silk performer proprietary language called Benchmark Description Language or BDL.
The scripting language used by Silk Performer is called Benchmark Description Language (BDL). BDL is not case-sensitive.

_Following is a list of the snippets:_
* Find out the actual size of array (ignoring empty stuff)
* Insertion sort
