# Silk Performer functions
This repository contains some of the interesting silk performer code snippets for my Silk projects. 
The scripting language used by Silk Performer is called Benchmark Description Language (BDL). BDL is not case-sensitive.

_Following is a list of the snippets:_
* Find out the actual size of array (ignoring empty stuff)
* Insertion sort
* Read json file and parse it


They are tested and working with Silk Performer v16.5 and v17.0
